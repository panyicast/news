  HELSINKI — A cargo spacecraft has arrived at China’s Tiangong space station, delivering supplies, experiments and equipment to support crewed missions.
  <p>
   The Tianzhou-8 spacecraft launched atop a Long March 7 rocket from the coastal Wenchang spaceport at 10:13 a.m. Eastern (1513 UTC) Nov. 15. The spacecraft separated from the rocket around 10 minutes into the flight.
   <p>
    Tianzhou-8 docked with Tiangong just over three hours later, at 1:32 p.m. Eastern (1832 UTC). The spacecraft docked with the space station’s aft port , according to the China Manned Space Engineering Office (CMSEO).
    <p>
     The spacecraft is carrying around 6,000 kilograms of supplies, according to China Central Television. Most of this is dedicated to supporting the ongoing Shenzhou-19 crewed mission, which
     launched
     Oct. 29, and the future Shenzhou-20 crew.
     <p>
      The payload mass includes 458 kilograms of scientific application materials, including experiment payloads, units and samples, as well as spare parts and application consumables.
      <p>
       One of the experiments aboard Tianzhou-8 is a
       set of bricks
       made from varying compositions of lunar regolith simulant. The bricks will be deployed on external racks outside Tiangong and exposed to the harsh vacuum and radiation and temperature environments of outer space for around three years. These will then be returned to Earth for analysis and could inform how China plans to construct habitats for its planned International Lunar Research Station (
       ILRS
       ) in the 2030s.

          Tianzhou-8 will carry bricks made of lunar simulant. These will be placed outside Tiangong for ~3 years to assess the impact of the harsh outer space environment. Results will help inform plans for future lunar habitats related to China's ILRS. Images via CCTV

       Beyond materials for lunar research, Tianzhou-8 also supports biological studies related to long-term space exploration. These will be later frozen and returned to Earth, where researchers will examine the changes in gene expression due to microgravity and the lack of magnetic field and compare them with control groups on the ground. The experiment is part of understanding how animal behavior, reproduction and brain function is affected by space travel.
       <p>
        The Tianzhou-8 spacecraft is reported to have an extra 102 kilograms of payload capacity over the Tianzhou-6 and Tianzhou-7 missions. Both previous missions themselves were designed to carry around 20 percent more payload (maximum 7,400 kg) than the first five Tianzhou spacecraft.
        <p>
         China aims to operate the three-module Tiangong for at least a decade. The country is also planning to
         expand the space station to six modules
         , as well as adding the co-orbital Xuntian space telescope to the complex in the coming years.
         <p>
          CMSEO recently awarded contracts to two companies to
          develop prototypes of low-cost cargo concepts
          to supply Tiangong. The program will provide backup options to supply Tiangong and increase capabilities such as potential downmass. The Tianzhou/Long March 7 combination is currently China’s only method of supplying Tiangong.
          <p>
           One concept is the Qingzhou cargo spacecraft from Microsat, to launch on the first CAS Space Kinetica-2 kerosene-liquid oxygen launcher in the second half of 2025, while
           Haolong
           is a reusable shuttle being developed by the Aviation Industry Corporation of China (AVIC), previously thought to have been engaged in China’s spaceplane projects. Haolong will launch on a rocket by land horizontally on a runway.
           <p>
            The Tianzhou-8 mission was China’s 56th orbital launch of 2024. It follows the launches of the
            Haiyang-4 (01)
            oceanography satellite and
            15 satellites
            aboard a Lijian-1 (Kinetica-1) commercial solid rocket earlier this week.
            <p>
             The country’s main space contractor CASC had announced early this year that it and China’s commercial launch service providers targeted a combined total of around 100 launches this year. Both CASC and commercial launchers appear to be well behind this target. The debut launch of the new
             Long March 12
             is expected in the coming weeks from a new commercial spaceport near Wenchang. Major missions already completed include the
             Chang’e-6
             lunar mission which delivered to Earth the first ever samples collected from the lunar far side.
