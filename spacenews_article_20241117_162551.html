  Washington, D.C – The Commercial Spaceflight Federation (CSF) announced the addition of its newest Associate Member, Aetherflux, a new aerospace company focused on building a commercial space-based solar power business. Aetherflux is joining CSF to help better interact with Congress and the Executive Branches as the company works to make space solar power a reality.
  <span id="more-506916">
  </span>
  <p>
   Aetherflux aims to deliver renewable power around the world by collecting solar energy from space. The company’s novel approach uses infrared lasers and a constellation of small, modular satellites in Low Earth Orbit. Space solar allows for power delivery day and night, as well as using smaller receivers compared to collecting sunlight on large solar panel farms on Earth.
   <p>
    The company will first focus on powering remote regions where delivering power is expensive, challenging, or dangerous, with applications in defense and national security. In the long term, Aetherflux aims to provide baseload and renewable energy for commercial and civilian use.
    <p>
     “CSF welcomes Aetherflux and the exciting new mission to commercialize space solar power”, said Dave Cavossa, President of the Commercial Spaceflight Federation.
     <p>
      “Our long-term vision is to develop a scalable, global energy solution that mitigates climate change and improves energy access worldwide,” said Baiju Bhatt, Founder and CEO of Aetherflux. “If we’re successful, we will also unlock a new wave of commercialization in space. Just as electricity and fossil fuels powered the industrial revolution, space solar power has potential to accelerate economic and technological growth.”
     </p>
     <p>
      Aetherflux’s team has experience from Robinhood, SpaceX, Luminar, and Continental, among others. The company has purchased its satellite bus, started building the payload and optical system, and is backed by Baiju Bhatt.
