  Louisville, Colorado — November 4, 2024 – EOI Space is thrilled to announce the successful completion of the first phase testing of our leading-edge, sixth-generation hall effect thruster (HET-F). The testing was performed on the flight version of our electronic propulsion system. This significant milestone not only meets but exceeds our expectations in performance. This achievement showcases the extraordinary capabilities of our engineering team and underscores our commitment to advancing space missions operating in a VLEO orbit. The comprehensive testing process was conducted at the University of Washington in recent weeks. We have moved to a larger test chamber at the University of Washington and look forward to seeing the results of testing at higher power levels. The thruster has proven to exceed the requirements we need to stay on orbit for 5-years.
