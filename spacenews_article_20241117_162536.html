  SEAKR hardware components to integrate into the Antaris Cloud Platform to support the need for end-to-end Full Mission Virtualization™ across multiple Department of Defense contracts.
 </h3>
 <p>
  Los Altos, CA – November 4, 2024 – Antaris™, the leading software platform for space missions, today announced that it is collaborating with SEAKR Engineering, LLC., part of RTX’s Raytheon business, to integrate SEAKR products into the Antaris Cloud Platform to conduct remote hardware-in-the-loop (HITL) testing and certification. The combined work deepens Antaris’ ability to provide end-to-end Full Mission Virtualization™ capabilities to the U.S. Department of Defense under multiple contracts.

  <p>
   Antaris dramatically simplifies the design, simulation, and operation of satellites by abstracting space vehicle components – including radios, imagers, thrusters, etc. – into its next generation TrueTwin™ simulation environment. Because this abstraction process incorporates all the satellite subsystems and their associated software, a TrueTwin™ virtual satellite can replicate at scale the same behaviors and functions as a physical satellite that has yet to be built. As a result, engineers can create a fully virtualized mission of their proposed spacecraft and ground systems.
   <p>
    Antaris will integrate its cloud platform with SEAKR Engineering’s subsystems hosted at their Colorado headquarters.  The companies will then utilize TrueTwin™ to run simulations involving SEAKR hardware – such as the high-performance, autonomy enabled Sentinel product line – to validate their performance and functionality.
    <p>
     “By integrating SEAKR Engineering’s payload catalog into the Antaris Cloud Platform, teams will be able to test mission concepts and validate hardware choices before buying a single screw,” said Tom Barton, CEO and Co-Founder of Antaris. “We’re excited to offer SEAKR’s hardware within the Antaris Cloud Platform, which will accelerate the ability of customers to operate in space with maximum efficiency, leveraging better data and streamlined processes for enhanced decision-making.”
     <p>
      “SEAKR’s state of the art development lab allows companies like Antaris to reduce risk and streamline SEAKR mission sets while utilizing proven on orbit HITL platforms,” said Erik Arvesen, General Manager of SEAKR Engineering LLC. “By integrating with the Antaris Cloud Platform, mission planners and system engineers can more easily design, simulate, and operate satellite constellations with our components, enabling the Department of Defense, civilian agencies, and our commercial customers to achieve greater operational efficiency and improved reliability.”
